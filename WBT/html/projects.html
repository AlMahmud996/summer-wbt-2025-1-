        <h2>Real-Time Waste Detection and Classification Using YOLOv12-Based Deep Learning Model</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on the development of a real-time waste detection and classification system using the
            YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once) deep learning architecture. The primary goal is to automate the identification
            and categorization of waste materials—such as plastic, metal, paper, and organic waste—by utilizing a
            high-performance object detection model.

            By training YOLOv12 on a labeled dataset of diverse waste images, the system can accurately detect and
            classify waste items from live camera feeds or static images. The model is optimized for both speed and
            accuracy, making it suitable for integration with smart bins, recycling stations, and environmental
            monitoring systems.</p>

        <h2>GAME HUB with C#</h2>
        <p>Game Hub is a web-based platform I developed to bring together a collection of games in one place. It serves
            as a
            digital arcade where users can browse and play different games directly from the browser. The project
            focuses on
            smooth user interaction, responsive design, and modular code structure to make it easy to add new games.
            Where
            admin can upload any types of game and the customer or the Users can download the game for play. There was a
            section for registration the new game. And a user's portfolio. I made the Game Hub with my 4 team mates and
            We
            use C# core code for the whole game build up.</p> <br>

        <h2>Rent A Garage – Vehicle Parking & Rental Management System</h2>
        <p>"Rent A Garage" is a desktop-based software application developed in Java that enables users to rent garages
            for
            their vehicles and allows garage owners to manage their available spaces. Designed with user-friendly
            interfaces
            and secure data handling, this system streamlines the process of temporary vehicle storage in urban areas.

            The software supports both owners and renters, allowing vehicle users to find suitable garage spaces and pay
            rental fees, while garage owners can list, manage, and track bookings efficiently.

        <h2>Time-Based Automatic Soft Drinks Dispenser</h2>
        <p>This project is a micr ocontroller-based automation system designed to dispense soft drinks automatically
            based on
            a set time duration. The goal is to eliminate manual effort and ensure accurate, consistent beverage
            dispensing
            using an efficient, time-controlled mechanism.

            The system is built using a programmable controller (Arduino Uno) and integrates components like motors,
            relays,
            and sensors to control the dispensing process. Users can press a button to trigger the system, and it will
            dispense a fixed volume of soft drink for a specific duration.</p> <br>
